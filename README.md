# Mastermind
A project using a raspberry pi and some connections to create a version of the Mastermind board game from the 70s. Apart from the electronics, a mixture of C and assembly will be used for the programming side of things. Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. In this project, one player shall be the raspberry pi and the other shall be the user. The raspberry pi will create a random code that the user has to try to break. Attempting to break this code is done in rounds, where the player guesses and the raspberry pi tells them how close they were to the right answer in terms of exact and approximate matches.
